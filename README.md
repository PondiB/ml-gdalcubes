# Machine Learning-gdalcubes PoC

Welcome to the ml-gdalcubes PoC repository! This project is a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploring the use of machine learning (ML) techniques with the GDALCubes R library.

## Overview

This repository showcases the integration of classical and deep learning models with the GDALCubes library for both classification and regression tasks.

## Machine Learning Models

### Classical ML Models

1. **Random Forest**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **XGBoost**

These models will be used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Deep Learning Models

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
2. **Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN)**
3. **Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)**

These models will focus on classification tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- R (version 4.0 or later)
- GDALCubes R library
- Required R packages for ML (e.g., caret, randomForest, e1071, xgboost, keras)
